# QUIZQUEST

## Introduction
Welcome to **QUIZQUEST**, a console-based quiz application developed in Java by *Joseph Korivi*.

Each round consists of randomly selected questions, and players can attempt the quiz as many times as they like.

## Features
- **Timed Questions**: Users must answer each question before the timer runs out.
- **Randomized Questions**: Every round presents a new set of questions to keep the game engaging.
- **Multiple Playthroughs**: Users can play as many rounds as they want.

## How to Play
1. Launch the application from the terminal.
2. Answer each question by selecting one of the four multiple-choice options.
